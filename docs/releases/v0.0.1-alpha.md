# XeniaVR v0.0.1-alpha (Pre-release)

## Summary
First public alpha of the XeniaVR fork. This build ships as a portable Windows package focused on early OpenXR integration, VR settings flow, and baseline runtime validation.

## Included
- `xenia_canary.exe`
- `openxr_loader.dll`
- `xenia-canary.config.toml`
- `LICENSE`
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- `VR_SMOKE_CHECKLIST.md`

## System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 x64
- GPU + driver with D3D12 support (Vulkan path is present but still under validation)
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (x64)
- Installed and active OpenXR runtime (SteamVR, Oculus, WMR, etc.)
- Xbox 360 game content set up as required by Xenia

## How To Run
1. Extract the ZIP to a writable folder (not Program Files).
2. Launch `xenia_canary.exe`.
3. Open `VR -> VR (OpenXR)` in the app menu.
4. Enable VR runtime in settings (`restart required`) and restart.
5. Start a title and tune VR settings / save per-title config.

## Known Issues
- Depth reprojection paths (D3D12/Vulkan) still need broader real-title validation.
- True stereo and per-eye guest camera integration are still in-progress and may fall back to scaffold behavior.
- Performance diagnostics UX is functional but still being polished.
- Portable-only distribution in this alpha (no installer yet).
- Checked/debug builds may surface assert-level issues not representative of release behavior.

## Notes
- This is an alpha intended for testing and feedback.
- Keep logs when reporting issues (`xenia.log`) and include headset/runtime details.
